## Skills

####  Programming

Since the first day of programming, I have enjoyed the complexity and the challenges it gives me. Being in a constant state of learning drives me everyday to get the most out of it.

#### Team work

- I developed my teamworking skills  in a technical environment by working on several group projects during [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), such as [MakersBnb](https://github.com/Samellenrider/Makersbnb2) (Team of 4),  [Acebook](https://github.com/Samellenrider/acebook-bluejuly2017) (Team of 17) and [Pokemon gyroscope game](https://github.com/Samellenrider/pokeball) (Team of 4).

####  Leadership

- I got taught how to handle responsibilities for my work and others through leading/taking part in school committees and acting as a mentor on school trips abroad.

#### Teaching

- I became a snowboard teacher at a young age and have become confident sharing my skills with everyone regardless of age, origin or gender.

#### Communication

- As a non native english speaker I understand the importance of good communication to get my point across clearly. Working in a foreign country and teaching helped understanding the importance of it at a young age.
